# Scrollable Navbar with Dynamic Background

This project demonstrates a **responsive scrollable navbar** that changes its background color when the user scrolls down the page. It is designed as a part of my learning journey at **SkillCraft Technology**.

## Features

- **Fixed Navbar**: The navbar stays at the top of the page even when scrolling.
- **Dynamic Background**: The navbar changes its background color when the page is scrolled.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Hover effects on navbar links and smooth background color changes.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout works seamlessly on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling and transitions for the navbar and content.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for detecting scroll events and applying styles dynamically.

## How It Works

1. The **JavaScript** script listens for the `scroll` event.
2. When the user scrolls past 50 pixels (`window.scrollY > 50`), a class `.scrolled` is added to the navbar.
3. The `.scrolled` class changes the background color of the navbar.
4. Links in the navbar have hover effects for better interactivity.
